# masdb

is currently a work in progress.

Originally, the project was created to solve the absence of a database for dogs of the breed Mini American Shepherd, modelled on the existing database for Border Collies, [Anadune](http://www.anadune.com/).

It was supposed to be written in Go and Ember.js as a final project for the professional development course I was attending at the time. For several reasons, it never came to fruition.

This is a new attempt using PostgreSQL, Hibernate ORM, Java and later, Spark. It is meant to give me the opportunity to learn and play around with Hibernate and Spark.

If you have any questions about the plans for this project, please feel free to contact me.
